All credit for this repositority goes to my brother from another mother, **Tolga Erok**.  His work inspired me to create my own personal use-case repositories for different Linux Distributions that I have tried and moved on for one reason or another.

Any repositories with *brian-* as a prefix are my personal use case.  Others have been forked from other places throughout the WWW.

You can find Tolga's work at his personal hub https://github.com/tolgaerok
